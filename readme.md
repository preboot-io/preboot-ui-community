**PreBoot UI Community**

A collection of React components that work seamlessly with the PreBoot.io backend to instantly create modern and consistent interfaces for your SaaS applications.

**What is it about?**
PreBoot UI Community is an open-source library of UI components built with React and TypeScript. It was designed with one goal in mind: to maximize the development speed for Java developers who are building web applications based on the PreBoot.io backend.
These components are not just "pretty buttons." They are "smart" and understand the conventions of your backend, such as handling validation, pagination, or data formatting.

**Why is it worth it?**
ðŸš€ **Instant start:** Ready-to-use, fully styled components that let you build a UI in hours, not weeks.
ðŸ§© **Seamless integration with PreBoot.io:** The components are made to work with the PreBoot.io API. Forget about manually mapping validation errors or handling pagination â€“ it works "out-of-the-box."
ðŸŽ¨ **Easy to style and customize:** The library is built on Mantine UI components and a system of design tokens, which allows for easy customization of the look and feel to match your brand.
âœ… **Quality and consistency:** All components follow best practices, support TypeScript, and take care of accessibility (a11y) fundamentals.
ðŸ“¦ **Lightweight and modular:** You only import the components you really need.
